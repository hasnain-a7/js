// string methods
/*slice function is like index in cpp. we can use it to get string character on base of index value. 
for example Hasnain has 7 characters and if i want to access H. 
we write function as slice(0,1)
the output will be H */



// const sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';
// const index = 4;
// console.log(`The character at index ${index} is ${sentence.charAt(4)}`);
